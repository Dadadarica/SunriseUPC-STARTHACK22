# START Hack 2022 - SunriseUPC Case

### Who are we
Sunrise UPC's OTT division Wilmaa is a pioneer in the field of WebTV and stands for digital television on all screens in all usage situations - from smartphones on the move, through tablets and computers to large screens at home. The platform reaches around 300,000 unique clients per month and is particularly popular with the digital natives thanks to its constant innovative strength.
Wilmaa was as its own company in the OTT business for more than 10 years and the first with TV in the Browser (at this time with a player based on Flash). Wilmaa got bought in 2020 by Sunrise and finished the development of their new TV Platform and released it for Sunrises sub-brand Yallo in October 2021.

The team (about 30 People) continues in world of TV with a special focus on Content. With the latest merger with UPC we've gotten pretty close to Ice Hockey with MySports too.

### Case Introduction
Accurate content suggestion increases user’s satisfaction while using a TV Platform. Aside from the conventional content categorization based on genre, main actors or release year, having an new dimension (emotions-centered) content suggestion would cover a specific gap while a user is exploring content to watch. We want to find a way to target user’s content recommendation based on their emotions and state of mind. This way a user would always get recommended content matching their mood.
We have our own TV Platform which we control from the Backend all the way to all of the Clients (Web, Mobile Apps and Televisions). We have all the Data on our side available like Data about when is airing which program (EPG) as well as the detailed information about the program itself (asset). This TV Platform and Clients are used for classical TV and in a special version for Sports. Hockey in particular.
While trying to find new ways for the users to discover content, if we effectively factor in people’s emotions into the equation, we would guarantee that no user would ever close our app under the impression they couldn’t find a suitable program.

* Which horror movie is scarier?
* Was this hockey game thrilling or not?
* Where did other people shout or cheer?

One direction we could imagine is a solution to detect and track consumers’ emotions while using our products (with their consent for each Session). One idea could be to use a wearable-like Apple Watch to track Heart Rate and/or through the microphone detect sound patterns suggesting emotions. Combining each user’s sensed data with content trends statistics could provide a reliable source of information to deduce a user's preferred type of content at all times.

Our expected final solution would be an accurate manner to suggest content to the user’s, based on collected biometric information, statistical data and available programs.

At the end the "new way of content discovery" is up to you to find a solution for ;) Think out of the box! Get crazy ;)
